# vim-desat
Gray and desaturated colorscheme for vim and neovim. If all the other ones are to poppy and/or colorful.

## Install

Either just copy the vim file into the colors folder or use something like Plug to point to this repo. Then just:

```vim
colorscheme desat
```

Sometimes you might need to tell vim this is a dark theme, then put this before:

```vim
set background=dark
```

## Acknowledgements

A former colleague of mine once said "it's a terminal, it's not a Christmas tree". Such inspiration.
